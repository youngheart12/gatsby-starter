he Election Commission has made it clear that Bihar will go to assembly election this year, that is, sometime in October. Some studies have anticipated September-October to be the time when coronavirus pandemic will peak in Bihar.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is seeking a fourth straight electoral victory in the upcoming polls. He is challenged by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, the son of Nitish Kumar's arch rival Lalu Prasad.

Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad were partner in politics for around two decades before they parted ways in the mid-1990s. They joined hands briefly for the 2015 Bihar Assembly polls. Tejashwi Yadav was the deputy CM in the government that formed before Nitish Kumar pulled out to rejoin the NDA in 2017.

Now when Nitish Kumar eyes technically a sixth term as Bihar chief minister (including an eight-day stint in 2000 and two terms interspersed by a nine-month term of Jitan Ram Manjhi in the previous Vidhan Sabha) he faces not only the Tejashwi Yadav-led coalition of RJD and the Congress but also plethora of problems that the people of Bihar are facing.

**RAGING CORONAVIRUS**

Bihar is one of the hotspots of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. Bihar has the sixth highest number of active Covid-19 patients with many experts suspecting that this may not be the actual number of active cases of Covid-19 in the state.

Bihar has the lowest Covid-19 testing rate in the country. It conducts 7,917 tests per 10 lakh people against the national average of 18,086. At 14.7 days, Bihar has the third-worst doubling rate against the national average of 23.6 days.

Nitish Kumar and other leaders of the ruling alliance have been at the receiving end of public ire in the view of the coronavirus threat. Nitish Kumar is also facing a serious challenge from ally Chirag Paswan, the LJP president. Chirag Paswan has openly criticised Nitish Kumar for the 'inept' handling of coronavirus pandemic in Bihar.

**FLOOD**

A large part of Bihar is under floodwater. Some of the areas are also battling with a Covid-19 spike. The flood problem is not new for Bihar. But when Nitish Kumar pitches his poll campaign by drawing a comparison of 15 years of his rule with 15 years of Lalu-Rabri rule, flood remains a constant failure of both regimes.

According to the Disaster Management Department, this year's deluge has swamped 1,232 panchayats across 16 districts of the state. At least 23 people have been reported dead in flood-related incidents.

Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur are among the worst-hit districts with a combined affected population of 34 lakh. The Opposition has made flood an election issue with Tejashwi Yadav earlier posting a photograph of a bridge that collapsed due to flood in his home district Gopalganj.

Last year when monsoon brought excessive rain in a short span of time, many areas of capital Patna were under floodwater. While Nitish Kumar and his ministers preferred safety, Jan Adhikar Party leader Pappu Yadav waded through the waterlogged areas of Patna distributing food and milk packets. He has made flood one of the key issues in his public meetings ahead of state election.

Going into 2005 Bihar Assembly polls, Nitish Kumar too had made similar promises of finding a permanent solution to the flood problem. But 15 years later, half of Bihar is still battling with flood.

Interestingly, some of these flood-affected people were seen standing waist-deep in water chanting "Jai Shri Ram" on the day of the Bhoomi Poojan for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

**ISSUE OF MIGRANTS**

Out-migration is another long-standing problem of Bihar, which supplies labour force to most of the developing cities of the country -- from Ladakh to Kerala and Manipur to Gujarat. Policymakers have long said that lack of economic development in the state has forced generations of Biharis to flee, looking for work in other states.

However, the fact that Bihar had a migrant problem of its own came to the fore during the coronavirus lockdown. The sudden announcement of lockdown in March shut down factories, shops and other businesses across the country.

Labourers working in these businesses for paltry incomes soon exhausted their means of livelihood and started walking home to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. While the Uttar Pradesh administration looked prompt in offering the incoming migrants some relief in terms of local employment, its counterpart in Bihar stared at an uncertain prospect.

Now, many of them have started demanding jobs from the Nitish Kumar government, which is seeking a fresh mandate.

**INDIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION**

A report by The Lancet recently said Bihar is the most vulnerable Indian state to the coronavirus pandemic. Eight of 20 districts listed by The Lancet as the most vulnerable to coronavirus pandemic are from Bihar.

The Lancet report found Bihar's health infrastructure abysmally poor to handle a health crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. Bihar has only 0.11 beds for every 1,000 people and just 0.39 doctors.

Local residents complain in most districts that government hospitals are not attended by doctors but by contractual health workers who are not trained to diagnose patients.

In the middle of the biggest health crisis, a statement by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi went viral in which he blamed the Lalu-Rabri regime for not building enough hospitals in Bihar.

**LAW & ORDER**

The law and order situation, which has been the selling point for the Nitish Kumar government since his first term, also presents a grim picture of the state. Banks have been looted in Bihar -- including one in Patna in broad daylight. Jewellery showrooms and gas agencies have been targeted by robbers. Reports say bikes and cars have been snatched on highways during day time.

Chirag Paswan and Tejashwi Yadav have been taking swipes at Nitish Kumar mocking his political catchphrase of "sushaasan" (good governance). Some political observers in Bihar say law and order has become a serious election issue in Bihar for the first time since 2005.

**UNEMPLOYMENT**

According to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) in June this year, Bihar recorded nearly double the national unemployment rate in the year ended June 2019.

This state of unemployment, experts say, got aggravated during the coronavirus lockdown, when the businesses shut down in Bihar like everywhere else and lakhs of migrants returned home after losing their jobs.

Earlier, another CMIE report said Bihar's unemployment rate increased 31.2 percentage points in April 2020 -- rising up to 46.6 per cent. The CMIE survey said unemployment rate in Bihar rose from 1.6 per cent in April 2017 to its current rate.

A sizeable portion of migrants who returned from industrial states is not willing to go back to those states. They demand similar employment in their own states. However, Bihar has very low prevalence of industrial employment.

The state government is reaching out to the migrants in villages and urban areas with financial aid promising education for their children in government schools. The process of enlisting of migrants and children in all districts is underway.

However, in many cases, the returning migrants don't want their kids to go to government schools. They have instead demanded better employment so that they can afford to educate their children in private schools.

Whether Nitish Kumar returns as the chief minister in Bihar in October-November depends a lot on how the BJP-JDU-LJP alliance sets the narrative to answer people's questions on these issues.
